1. Disclosure of AI Tool Usage
In accordance with the ECON485 course syllabus and the requirements of Homework 4, I hereby declare that Gemini (Google AI) and DeepSeek were used as supportive tools during the preparation of this assignment.

2. Scope of Assistance
The AI tools were utilized for the following tasks:

Research & Concept Explanation: Clarifying specific NoSQL concepts such as Redis atomic counters and MongoDB's document-level atomicity.

Technical Comparisons: Generating initial comparison tables between SQL and NoSQL performance metrics.

Code Snippets: Providing base templates for Python/Redis interactions and MongoDB JSON document structures.

Refining & Formatting: Structured using Gemini for report flow and DeepSeek for technical code verification and additional insights on MongoDB indexing.

3. Student Verification and Originality
While AI assisted in the drafting and formatting process:

Technical Accuracy: All AI-generated explanations and code snippets were reviewed and cross-checked against official documentation (Redis.io, MongoDB.com) and course materials.

Contextualization: The solutions were specifically adapted to the "University Course Registration System" scenario developed in Homeworks 1, 2, and 3.

Final Review: I have personally reviewed the entire PDF report to ensure it meets the academic standards and requirements set by the instructor.

4. Tools Used
