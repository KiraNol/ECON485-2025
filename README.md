# Homework 3: SQL JOIN Queries

## Student Information
- Name: Elif Işıl Çiçek
- Student ID: 23232810007
- Date: December 2025

## Assumptions Made
1. Used Homework 2 database schema with tables: Student, Course, Instructor, Section, Registration, Prerequisite, Grade.
2. Grade comparisons use alphabetical order (A > B > C > D > F).
3. For Task 4, used 'ECON211' as example target course.
4. A student is considered "eligible" if they passed ALL prerequisites with minimum required grade.
5. Prerequisite minimum grades are stored as single characters (A, B, C, D).

## AI Usage Disclosure
- Used ChatGPT for SQL query optimization and syntax checking.
- All business logic and database design are my own work based on Homework 1 and 2.
- AI was used only for code formatting and error checking.

## Notes
- Queries tested with sample data from Homework 2.
- All JOIN operations use appropriate foreign key relationships.
- NULL handling implemented for missing prerequisites/grades.
