# ECON485 Homework 1 - Part 2: Selected Basic Concepts

## Selected Basic Entities for Simple Registration System

For the simplified registration system (no rules, no constraints), the following **5 basic entities** are required:

1. **Student** – Represents a university student
2. **Course** – Represents an academic course
3. **Section** – Represents a specific offering of a course in a semester
4. **Instructor** – Represents the teacher of a section
5. **Registration** – Represents the relationship between a Student and a Section (enrollment)

## Next Step
These 5 entities will be used in **Part 3** to create a 2NF database design and ER diagram.
